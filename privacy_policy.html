<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Last updated: December 18, 2025</p>

<p>Chris Chui ("us", "we", or "our") operates the "Color Finder Auto Clicker" mobile application (the "Service").</p>

<div class="legal-note">
    <strong>Important Notice for Google Play Compliance:</strong>
    Our Service utilizes the AccessibilityService API and MediaProjection API to perform its core automation features. We are committed to transparency and user privacy.
</div>

<h2>1. Consent</h2>
<p>By using our Service, you hereby consent to our Privacy Policy and agree to its terms.</p>

<h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>We collect information primarily through third-party services and localized app functions to provide and improve our Service.</p>

<h3>Types of Data Collected (via Third-Parties):</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Device Identifiers and Usage Data:</strong> Unique device IDs, IP addresses, advertising identifiers (AdMob), and usage patterns.</li>
    <li><strong>Diagnostic Data (Firebase Crashlytics):</strong> Crash traces and system activity data to help us fix bugs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Use of Sensitive Permissions & APIs</h2>
<p>To provide automated clicking and color detection, our Service requires access to the following sensitive Android APIs:</p>

<h3>3.1 AccessibilityService API</h3>
<p>We use the <span class="highlight">AccessibilityService API</span> to perform automated clicks, swipes, and multi-touch gestures. This is essential for the "Auto Clicker" functionality.
<ul>
    <li><strong>No Data Collection:</strong> We DO NOT use the Accessibility API to collect any personal or sensitive information.</li>
    <li><strong>No Setting Changes:</strong> We DO NOT change user settings or prevent users from disabling/uninstalling any service without permission.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>3.2 MediaProjection API (Screen Capture)</h3>
<p>Our Service uses the <span class="highlight">MediaProjection API</span> to capture screen content for real-time color identification.
<ul>
    <li><strong>Temporary Local Storage:</strong> Screenshots taken for "Recording" or "Inspect Color" features are stored locally in the App's internal cache/folder.</li>
    <li><strong>Ephemeral Processing:</strong> These images are processed locally on your device to detect colors and are never transmitted to any external servers.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>4. How We Use Your Information</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Provide, operate, and maintain the automation Service.</li>
    <li>Analyze screen colors to trigger user-defined automated actions.</li>
    <li>Improve app stability via crash reporting.</li>
    <li>Serve advertisements via AdMob.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Data Storage and Deletion</h2>
<p>Regarding the screen captures and action logs saved by the app:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Internal Storage:</strong> All captured images are saved only in the application's private directory (App Folder).</li>
    <li><strong>User Control:</strong> Users can manually delete any "Inspect Color" records and their associated image files within the app interface.</li>
    <li><strong>Full Erasure:</strong> Uninstalling the application will automatically delete all locally stored data and images created by the app.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Third-Party Service Providers</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Google Play Services</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> For personalized and non-personalized advertising.</li>
    <li><strong>Google Firebase:</strong> For analytics and crash reporting.</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Donations and Financial Data</h2>
<p>Donations are processed via external platforms (PayPal, PayMe, FPS). <strong>We do not collect or store your credit card or bank details.</strong></p>

<h2>8. Data Protection Rights (GDPR & CCPA)</h2>
<p>Users have the right to access, rectify, or erase their personal data. Since we do not store personal data on our servers, these rights apply primarily to the data stored locally on your device or handled by Google services.</p>

<h2>9. Children's Information</h2>
<p>We do not knowingly collect personal identifiable information from children under 13.</p>
